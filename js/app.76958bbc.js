profiling for a Corexy style pen plotter",slug:"corexy",subtitle:"August 2021",body:"One of my recent projects at university was designing a control system for drawing shapes using an XY pen plotter. For this project we were tasked with designing a controller to draw a rectangle and a circle of arbitrary dimensions, within given time and error constraints. The provided XY table was powered by 2 DC gearmotors with integrated quadrature encoders, configured in a Core XY style belt and pulley system (https://corexy.com/theory.html). These constraints, combined with the poor construction and high friction of the XY table (glad to see the 10k a year I'm spending on tuition is being well spent), made for quite an interesting control problem. This article goes into some depth around how I specified and chose the control method that we utilised to effectively complete these tasks.\n\nOne of the main features I wanted to implement is to ensure the controller has some form of motion planning. The theory behind motion planning is to only update your setpoint as quickly as the system can move, therefore allowing for smooth and continuous motion. With motion planning the controller follows an open loop profile, defined based on the kinematics of the system, and the desired outputs. One of the major benefits of this is that the controller doesn't need to wait for sensor outputs to make control changes. This allows most of the control effort to be achieved proactively, instead of reactively, therefore, achieving a better system response.\n\nThis project is a perfect use case for motion planning. The objectives we need to achieve are known in advance, as the controller knows the dimensions and shape that it needs to draw before the system starts. This combined with the straightforward kinematics of the system gives a great opportunity to effectively use motion planning. Feedback can also easily be added with a simple P controller to account for any disturbances or variation.\n\nTherefore, we decided to design a controller based around 1 dimensional motion profiles. The concept of motion profiling is to define a profile which encodes how a state vector changes over time during a movement. Normally the information encoded in this state vector would be a position value, a velocity value, and an acceleration value. The shape of these profiles can effectively be anything, however there are a couple of simple and effective controllers that are commonly used:![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/891215064022007828/unknown.png 'Trapezoidal and S-curve motion profiles')\n\n### Trapezoidal Motion Profiles\n\nThe shape ensures that the velocity slowly increases and decreases (at a defined acceleration) which reduces potential inaccuracies caused by high acceleration. This is a very effective profile, which is very easy to implement and is computationally simple to calculate. The main issue with this controller is the infinite jerk, the derivative of acceleration, at the start and ends of the acceleration/deceleration periods. High levels of jerk can cause problems in very sensitive systems, where the induced vibrations can detrimentally affect system performance. This is the problem that S-curve motion profiles fix.\n\n### S-Curve Motion Profiles\n\nS-curve motion profiles follow a similar design philosophy as trapezoidal motion profiles. The main change is that the acceleration profile forms trapezoids as the acceleration linearly increases to reach the maximum value. This profile results in a defined maximum jerk value, which helps reduce vibration and can improve system performance compared to the trapezoidal profile with infinite jerk. Therefore, an s-curve profile is a more ideal form of control; however, it is significantly more computationally intensive. It's also quite likely that the benefits of an s-curve profile will not significantly affect our system due to high friction being an effective damper to minimise any induced high frequency vibrations.\n\nWith this in mind, I decided to move forward with a trapezoidal motion profile for our motion planning. My plan was to define motion profiles in a cartesian XY coordinate system, and then use a simple inverse kinematics function to convert these profiles to angular quantities in the coordinate system for each motor.\n\nFor the controller an open loop velocity controller was combined with a closed loop position controller. The open loop velocity controller assumes that the velocity of the system is linear with respect to the control input. This is obviously a bit of an oversimplification due to non-linearities like friction. However, it should be close enough to achieve good results. The position controller simply use a P-controller to correct for any error between the expected value from the profile, and the actual recorded value from the sensors. Finally, we added an open loop acceleration term to the controller. This term accounts for the inertia of the system by providing additional control input when the system is accelerating, and reducing the control input when decelerating. These terms combine to form the following control laws in terms of the angular profile inputs. All profile variables are denoted with a hat, whereas measured variables (from encoders) are not.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/891447385090314250/unknown.png?width=1080&height=223 'Control laws')\n\nFinally, we had to design a system to somehow map a complex movement (like drawing a circle) to a couple of simple trapezoidal motion profiles. For drawing a rectangle this was very straightforward, 4 motion profiles are  used for each side of the rectangle, and then inverse kinematics converts this profile into an angular coordinate space. The circle was a little more difficult, the angle of the arc of the drawn circle was defined as the distance variable in the trapezoidal profile. This allows the profile to be defined from an arc angle of 0 radians, to 2π radians. The main benefit of defining the circle in this way is that it allows the change in arc angle to follow the shape of the velocity trapezoidal profile. This ensures that appropriate acceleration and decceleration occurs at the start and finish of the circle. When these profiles are generated, it's easy to convert them into an XY space (as we know the angle and radius of the arc). Then finally, inverse kinematics can be used to convert these form XY space to an angular space. This gives a smooth and accurate motion profile for the XY table to follow when drawing the desired shapes.\n\nThis was all implemented on an Arduino board using C++ (well, Arduino's highly limited C++). After some tuning we managed to achieve very good results, with low errors and a fast overall execution time. \n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/891453241588580454/unknown.png?width=1080&height=453 'Control system performance')\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/891453553447682108/unknown.png?width=1080&height=404 'Control system performance')",tags:["Control Systems"]},{title:"Electric Longboard Project",slug:"longboard",subtitle:"December 2019",body:"![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/743406792524038195/unknown.png 'Longboard')\nOver the summer I designed and built an electric longboard by modifying a cheap longboard with hobby RC components. The Longboard is powered using a 2.25kW brushless outrunner motor, which is capable at taking the board to theoretical speeds of up to 40km/h (not that I've ever been brave enough to push it anywhere close to that). This motor is driven by the open source VESC brushless speed controller, and is controlled from a handheld wireless controller. The whole setup is powered using two 6S LiPo batteries in series with a BMS to ensure the cells are kept at similar voltages.\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g7fqVJUZNLr4VwzhiCuvXVj14GGYdnhM/preview' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>",tags:[]},{title:"'Lossless' VEX Robot",slug:"lossless",subtitle:"March 2019 - April 2019",body:"![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/743305538162655272/unknown.png 'Lossless Robot')\nOur final robot we built for the VEX robotics competition 2018-2019 season was constructed after the 2019 VEX Robotics NZ National Championships. In preparation for the 2019 world championships in Kentucky we designed and built an entirely new robot, based on our robot for Nationals (High Quality). This new robot used a similar flywheel design for scoring game objects in the competition, it was simply a more refined robot based on the newer VEX hardware that was available to us. Due to time constraints we didn't make a video for this robot; however, the design functions very similar to our earlier iteration 'High Quality', which has a video on its page.\n\n'Lossless' competed at the 2019 VEX Robotics World Championships, where we made it to the semifinals in our division before we were eliminated from the competition.\n\n<br>",tags:["VEX Robotics Competition","Robotics","Control Systems"]},{title:"'High Quality' VEX Robot",slug:"high-quality",subtitle:"November 2018 - February 2019",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/458051657503080450/547697033474211840/IMG_5446-compressor.jpg?width=1870&height=1247 'High Quality Robot')\nFor our third robot we designed for the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics Competition season, we decided to switch focus to a flywheel launching mechanism (compared to the catapult design of 'Medium Quality'). This change allowed us to control the flywheel velocity to adjust the arc the ball takes when launched. Something which allowed us to shoot the game objects at the targets (the flags) from many different robot positions, and also allowing us to hit 2 flags simultaneously.\n\n 'High Quality' competed at the 2019 VEX Robotics NZ National Championships, finishing qualifications in first place and winning the Tournament Champions and Design Awards.\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEOX_e-BGyM' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>",tags:["VEX Robotics Competition","Robotics","Control Systems"]},{title:"'Snow White' Combat Robot",subtitle:"November 2018",slug:"snow-white",body:"![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/520168409388941322/534690647228284938/krWZpbl4tOeBWLsHGufc6KC1OtkOOQBi0v5BnwLLiRkZSk0TN5ckwOGS2k5ytg3L-hq3uvpVmsFvUQldGiRNlbZEDwmD9uhui8QS.png 'Snow White')Snow White was our second combat robot we built. It was built for the 2018 Combat Robotics Nationals. After building our first combat robot 'Doorstop' we wanted to try building a combat robot with an active weapon rather than the simple wedge design of Doorstop. Snow White was originally planned with a spinning drum weapon, but we were quickly running out of time and manufacturing a drum would have been very difficult to do in the time we had. So we decided to just go for a simple horizontal spinner. The blade for this horizontal spinner was just a steel brushcutter blade from a hardware store. This was belt driven by a brushless outrunner motor and all the components were bolted to a titanium base plate with HDPE side and back armour. All of this was built over only a few days, so we didn’t really have high hopes for how well it would perform.\n\n### The CAD design for Snow White\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/534691154596462602/5amCmOLuisaFi59LjpIqyssiCRTkeWsZvMAVNLbFHWdxGQP9bx9tUVOdXUlR29frzWPI5Mfxlq_5TOE6Ita51OZ0jHWCI-l8LYo6.png 'Snow White Render') \nUnfortunately the robot was quite front heavy, so the back wheels didn't get much traction which made driving very challenging. Because of this and some other issues we didn't perform too great at the competition, and the robot's final match can be seen below. \n\n#### The last match of Snow White...\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMPulFDPUpY?start=333' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n",tags:["Combat Robotics","Robotics"]},{title:"Resolution Robotics Team Website",slug:"website",subtitle:"October 2018",body:"![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/743425816032968704/unknown.png 'Resolution Robotics Website')\n\nFor one of my level 3 Digital Technology projects I decided to design and build a website for our independent robotics team we had recently started. This website was built off the Vue.js framework to streamline the development process, minimise repeated code, and allow for a Single Page Application website (improves flow across the website as the page doesn't refresh when navigating to subpages). This website also has a functional article section where content is fetched from an editable .json data file. With this system in place articles can be easily added to the webpage by simply editing a single data file. After editing this file the article is added to the article list, and all navigation menus are updated to reflect this. This allows for content to be added without touching the source code of the site. The articles are written in the popular markdown format which makes styling of the article content very simple. This markdown is automatically parsed to HTML and displayed on the site. Because of this, HTML elements can also be added to the data file if a specific element is desired (for example a YouTube embed).\n\n This portfolio website is based off the article section of the main website, and runs off the same code. The main website also features animations, responsive design, and is fully functional on mobile (including support for swipes).\n\n <a href='https://william-acourt.github.io/240P/'>The website is hosted on my github </a><br>",tags:["Web Development","Vue.js"]},{title:"'Medium Quality' VEX Robot",slug:"medium-quality",subtitle:"July 2018 - October 2018",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/724030950668763226/IMG_5965.jpg?width=1406&height=937 'Medium Quality Robot')\nThis was the second robot our independent team had ever built together. We built this robot for the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics Competition season, we decided to focus on quickly and effectively firing balls to toggle flags with this iteration. This strategy has a much higher score potential compared to our first robot of the season. We designed a slip gear catapult mechanism, using elastics to provide the high force required to fire two balls simultaneously at the flag targets.\n\n Medium Quality competed at the 2018 World Skills NZ National Championships in Hamilton where we finished with the gold medal in the Mobile Robotics Category.\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtBIXOg0EsI' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>",tags:["VEX Robotics Competition","Robotics","Control Systems"]},{title:"'Doorstop' Combat Robot",slug:"doorstop",subtitle:"July 2018",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/493614998262906900/hg6CGef7t2fQeZ_b7MAiDj9_kUK_qSWZnM0KpTJ5qs8GvhRmMbJrPfhY7z7wjyfKhtrqG7ekitvMwzmVwFhuqwGFsc71VOMQ0P0R.png 'Doorstop')Doorstop was our first attempt at building a robot outside of the VEX Robotics Competition, and our first attempt at building a combat robot. Doorstop was built in the beetleweight category for combat robots, which is for robots below 1.37kgs. As this was our first attempt for anything like this we built a simple design with only a powered drive. It comprised of a steel base and steel wedge with aluminum angle used for the sides and a polycarbonate cover for the top. Doorstop was powered with a 2 wheel brushed DC motor drive. Although it was our first attempt at combat robots, we actually did pretty well with Doorstop at our first competition, we ended up losing in finals and taking home the second place trophy.<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YfsVjocByA' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\n\n",tags:["Combat Robotics","Robotics"]},{title:"'Low Quality' VEX Robot",slug:"low-quality",subtitle:"June 2018",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/743989912231084152/ACtC-3cC8Awq3MjkG9RTH1_SYcJVIAOJ8bdF41m_nNMUqLmWg8G3d4dTKte0ETXTNGfaw5TRLWhb9oHxtLaXZBqZj2h9yyvjNMHK.png?width=930&height=1654 'Low Quality Robot')\nThis was the first robot our independent team had ever built together. We built this robot for the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics Competition season. We were heavily limited due to our lack of available parts and resources at this point in the season. Because of this, we built a fairly simple design to pick up the cap game elements and score them on posts (also with the ability to flip the caps so they our scored for our colour). All our future robots were significant improvements over this design, but this is how we started the season.\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/06cEBmGx7Fo?rel=0' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>",tags:["VEX Robotics Competition","Robotics","Control Systems"]},{title:"Astrophotography Star Tracker",slug:"stars",subtitle:"June 2018",body:"One of the first engineering projects I worked on was building a star tracker for astrophotography during my high school years. I had really started to enjoy astrophotography, but I was pretty disappointed by how expensive it was to move forward with the hobby. From the price of nice fast lenses, to the price of star trackers to enable longer shutter speeds, it was all well outside my price range at the time. Therefore, I decided to design and build my own star tracker using the hand tools I had available to me. A star tracker is a simple device which provides an axis of rotation, which when aligned correctly with the celestial north or south pole, and actuated at the same rate (but opposite direction) to the rotation of the earth, results in perfectly sharp and clear images of stars. The construction for my star tracker was very simple overall, two pieces of offcut plywood were connected together on one end with a hinge. This provided the necessary axis of rotation for the system. I actuated this hinge using a curved threaded rod, and a nut embedded in a gear. As the gear rotates, it rides up or down the curved threaded rod (which is attached to the top side of the hinge), and therefore reduces or increases the angle of the hinge. A couple of elastic bands were added to ensure that a constant force is provided to keep the hinge closed. This was necessary as the gear was free floating, and therefore wasn't necessarily constrained to the base of the hinge. The main gear was driven by a secondary gear which was connected to a cheap stepper motor. A stepper motor was chosen for this use case as they're affordable and can maintain a set constant velocity fairly well. This comprised most of the mechanical build of the system.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/891479936307724298/unknown.png 'Mechanical build of the star tracker')\n\n Although this mechanical build didn't look great due to the tools I had available to me, it was surprisingly solid, and performed well. The electronics of the system were powered by an Arduino pro mini, which was used with a stepper motor driver to actuate the stepper motor at the calculated rate to match the rotation of the earth. This Arduino was also used to drive an LCD board, which was used as the main user input for the star tracker. Finally, an HM-10 bluetooth module was connected to the Arduino to allow for the device to be configured over bluetooth. The main configuration options available were to change the direction of tracking (depending on which pole you're aligned to), change how long the system tracks for (so you can leave it running and it won't run indefinitely), and allow for micro-adjustments to the angular rate to further calibrate the system. All these settings could be adjusted over bluetooth using a phone, or through the connected LCD, which used a backlight so the user can see the settings they're changing at night. The backlight for the LCD would turn off when tracking started to ensure it doesn't cause any light to bleed into the final image. A comparison of an untracked (left) vs. tracked photo (right) taken at a focal length of 50mm (with an APS-C size sensor) is shown below.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/891482461366788096/unknown.png 'Star Tracker performance')\n\n Although this performance isn't perfect by any means, I still think it's fairly impressive considering the long focal length it was taken at. This project definitely had its flaws, but it was a lot of fun to make, and considering my knowledge at the time, I'm still pretty proud of what I achieved.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/891475940570451968/unknown.png 'Star Tracker')\n\n",tags:[]}]}},d92f:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var n=o("2eb5"),a=o.n(n);a.a},e216:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var n=o("4ab4"),a=o.n(n);a.a}});
